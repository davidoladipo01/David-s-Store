A simple web-based store app built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. This project allows you to add, edit, delete, and display products in a responsive grid layout.


Features:

2. Edit and delete products individually, delete first/last, or reverse the list.

3.Dynamic display using product cards with hover effects.

4.Clean UI with a “David Store” header and white container.
